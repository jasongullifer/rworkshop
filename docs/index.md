About this workshop
===================

In the spring of 2013, I co-taught a short course on R with my
colleague [Cari Bogulski](http://caribogulski.weebly.com/). The goal
of the workshop was to teach students in Penn State's [Department of
Psychology](http://psych.la.psu.edu/) and [Center for Language
Science](http://cls.psu.edu/) how to use R for their research. Many of
the students had no prior programming knowledge, and we felt it was
important to set the course at this level so that beginners can begin
to realize the awesome power of programming. I'm hoping that the same goals
can be achieved in this shorter workshop!

Many of the materials for this workshop (including some of the fake
datasets and exercises) have been repurposed for this class.
