#################  Attentional Networking Task  ##############################
## Attentional Networking Task: The Attentional Networking Task (ANT) is a sort 
## of cued Flanker task. There are four types of cue condition: (1) No cue, (2) 
## Central cue, (3) Double Cue, and (4) Spatial cue.  There are three types of 
## flankers: (1) Neutral, (2) Congruent, and (3) Incongruent. Flanker arrows may
## appear either up or down (above or below fixation), and the central/target 
## arrow may point either left or right. Ultimately, you want to extract summary
## data per participant per cue and flanker condition. Additionally, you need to
## compute 3 effects: the Alerting effect, the Orienting effect, and the
## Conflict effect. All of this should be done for each of the two groups
## "Control" and "Treatment"
##
##      These effects are computed as follows:
##
##	Alerting Effect = (RT to Double cue trials) - (RT to No cue trials)

##	Orienting Effect = (RT to Spatial cue trials) - (RT to Center cue trials)

##	Conflict Effect = (RT to Congruent trials) - (RT to Incongruent trials)
