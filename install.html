<h1>Installing R</h1>

<p>R is a cross-platform statistical computing package that runs in the command line. There are various interfaces that run and display R in a more user-friendly format. These are installed separately from R. One of the most popular and polished interfaces is called R studio, and it also happens to be cross-platform. </p>

<p>In this workshop, we will be using the latest version of R-project together with the RStudio interface. Feel free to try out different options and use what works best for you. Everything you learn in this workshop will be independent of the user interface you choose. </p>

<p>Below you can find the installation instructions for:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#Windows">Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="#Mac">Mac</a></li>
<li><a href="#Linux">Linux</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After you install R and R Studio, you should install the packages we'll be using in the workshop. The packages are platform independent. Don't worry, we'll go over what packages are and how to find them during the workshop.</p>
